The project followed a structured process from start to finish:

1.  **Data Cleaning:** Loaded the raw dataset and used Power Query to handle null values, remove duplicates, correct data types, and standardize column values. 
2.  **Data Modeling:** Established the data model within Power BI to ensure proper relationships between data fields.
3.  **DAX Calculations:** Created key measures to quantify attrition, including a main attrition count, attrition rate, average salary, and average tenure of employees who left.
4.  **Dashboard Development:** Designed a multi-page dashboard with a clean user interface. Key elements include:
    * **KPI Cards:** Displaying high-level metrics like total employees, attrition count, and attrition rate. 
    * **Charts:** Donut charts for attrition by gender, and column charts for attrition by age group, education field, and salary slabs. 
    * **Slicers:** Implemented department-level filters to allow for targeted analysis. 
    * **Matrix Visual:** Created a detailed table to show attrition numbers and job satisfaction scores by job role.
